# BMI-Calculator

Creating a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator in Python is a straightforward task. BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight and height. The formula for calculating BMI is:

**BMI = kg/m2**

**Explanation:**

Welcome Message: The print("Welcome to Bhim's BMI Calculator\n") line is a welcome message indicating the purpose of the program.

User Input: The script uses float(input("Enter your Weight in KG : ")) to get the user's weight in kilograms and float(input("Enter your Height in M : ")) to get the user's height in meters.

BMI Calculation: The script calculates the BMI using the formula BMI = Weight / Height ** 2

Rounding: The round(BMI, 2) function is used to round the calculated BMI to two decimal places.

Printing Result: The print(BMI) statement prints the calculated and rounded BMI.
